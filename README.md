# PHONEPE-TRANSACTION-INSIGHTS


The project is to create an end-to-end data analysis and visualization solution using the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. The workflow includes:

Data Extraction: Automating the process to clone the repository and retrieve raw JSON data files.

Data Transformation: Utilizing Python and Pandas to clean, preprocess, and structure the data for analysis.

Database Insertion: Loading the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and querying.

Dashboard Development: Building an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly to visualize insights.

Dynamic Data Retrieval: Fetching data directly from the database to provide real-time, interactive visual updates.
